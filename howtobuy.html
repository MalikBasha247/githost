<h2>Desktop Computer Buying Guide </h2>
    
    <p> A desktop computer can be a smart and ergonomic pick if you’re setting up a home office and aren’t worried as much about mobility. Staring into a monitor puts less strain on your neck than staring down into a laptop. You also generally get more power per dollar spent with a desktop than you do with a laptop.
        <br><br>
        Some models come with a built-in display, while others require you to supply your own. Luckily, you can find good computer monitors for reasonable prices. In fact, while all-in-one models with a screen tend to be aesthetically pleasing and take up less desk space, they can cost a lot more than buying a desktop computer and monitor separately. 
        <br><br>
        Mac or PC? It’s really up to you. You’ll find models on both platforms that score well in our labs. They’ll support the most popular software options, too, from Adobe Photoshop to Chrome, Slack to Zoom. But there are benefits to pairing a Mac with an iPhone or an Android phone with a PC. You may be able to answer a text message with your keyboard, for example, or share copy-paste data between a computer and a smartphone.
    </p><br>


<h2>Desktop Computer Types </h2>


    <P>Desktops generally offer better bang for your buck compared with laptops, delivering more power and performance per dollar spent.
        <br><br>
        Depending on the model you choose, you may have to supply your own mouse, keyboard, and monitor. In that case, you might want to consider buying an ergonomic mouse and keyboard. And, given the rise of video chatting, you may also need a webcam, because freestanding monitors typically don't come with one built in.

        <h3>Full-Sized Desktop</h3>
        <p>They require a lot of room—either on top of or under your desk—but full-sized desktops tend to be 
        the least expensive computer option and the easiest to upgrade and repair.
        </p>

        <h3>Compact Desktop</h3>
        <p>At less than half the size of full-sized desktops, 
        compact or slim desktops are ideal if you lack space under your desk or 
        if you plan to put the computer on your desk.
        </p>

        <h3>All-in-One Desktop</h3>
        <p>
        All-in-one desktop computers, also known as "all-in-ones," 
        combine the computer and monitor. The components are tightly packed behind and underneath the display, 
        making the models difficult to upgrade or repair. 
        <br>Meant to be space-savers, they're also designed to look less stodgy than traditional computers.

        <h3>Gaming Desktop</h3>
        <p>
        The sky's the limit for gaming systems. You get the fastest processors, 
        the most sophisticated graphics cards, large hard drives, and lots of RAM. 
        Cases are usually large and offer room for additional components like extra memory or 
        dedicated sound cards. These models tend to be quite expensive.
